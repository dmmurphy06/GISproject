    "* *What was the Black urban ecology of safety in post-WWII Los Angeles?* Through analyzing Green Book location data from 1947 and 1956, before and after the outlaw of racially restrictive covenants, in Los Angeles, I seek to reveal a local landscape of safety and interrogate how shifts in discriminatory policies governing private and public space may have impacted this temporal network. \n",

    "* *What was the impact of shifts in neighborhood socioeconomic demographics on this ecology of safety?* I'd like to compare this with race and economic indicators such as blue or white collar work, leve of education, home values and rents by Census tract adjacent to these years to better understand both shifts and the spatial composition in these landscapes of safety amidst complex urban neighborhood changes.\n",
