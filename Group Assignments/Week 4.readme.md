# <hl> Week 4 Proposal Update
  Project proposal can be found [here](https://github.com/dmmurphy06/GISproject/tree/main/Group%20Assignments).
# <hl> Status Update
  Overall, I had some initial trepidation working alone on this project, but I know am incredibly excited about how this is taking shape. I want to be more intentional about collaborating with my classmates both when I encounter errors, but also to expand my own current thinking about my project and approach. Reviewing my classmates' homework assignments have been extremely helpful to my own learning.
# <hl> Data Update
  Initially, there was some concern about the acquisition of Census data from 1940-1960. Last week, Yoh shared an amazing resource, the [Los Angeles County Union Census Tract Data Series, 1940-1990](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KiflC3DOQJoo_DTiZGzbr3-_QhvTh1nl?usp=sharing) from Ethington, Kooistra, and DeYoung.  From this dataset, I am interested in the following variables and years that will help me better understand the racial demographics of the area.
  * **P40B:** Population Black non-White, 1940 
    * **P40T** used to calculate percentage of Black non-white population.
  * **P60B:** Population Black non-White, 1960
    * **P60T** used to calculate percentage of Black non-white population.
  * *I will consult 1950 as an informative datapoint, but this project is focused on the change explicitly before and after racially restrictive covenants were struck down in the 1948 *Shelley v. Kramer* decision.**
# <hl> Concerns
Given that median household income data does not begin until 1970, I am thinking of a couple approaches.
  * Continue to explore Social Explorer for Median Household Income for 1940-1960 (hopefully by Census tract)
  * Use a couple of variables from the Ethington et. al data as proxies for income in both 1940 and 1960 (where yy = year):
    * **EyyH:**	Education completed high school 
    * **EyyC:**	Education completed college 
    * **OyyWC:**	Occupation White Collar
    * **OyyBC:**	Occupation Blue Collar
    * **HyyMVL:**	Median value of dwelling/housing units
    * **HyyMRN:**	Housing Median Rent of Unit

  *I would love your insight on feedback on these potential proxies for income and how to use them.*
Additionally, I am thinking through which overlays would best to layer over the GreenBook location data to speak to the question raised around shifts in landscapes of safety.
