# <hl> Research Question
  In this assignment, I will be analyzing location data from the Green Book, a Jim-crow era Black travel guide created by former postal worker Victor Green.  The guide ran from 1936 - 1966 and 21 guides were recently digitized and open source data was released by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library. 

*What was the Black urban ecology of safety in post-WWII Los Angeles?* Through analyzing *Green Book* location data from 1947 and 1956,  before and after the outlaw of racially restrictive covenants, in Los Angeles, I seek to reveal a local landscape of safety and interrogate how shifts in discriminatory policies governing private and public space may have impacted this temporal network. *What was the impact of shifts in neighborhood racial demographics on this ecology of safety?* Next, I'd like to compare this with race and median household income by Census tract adjacent to these years to better understand both shifts and the spatial composition in these landscapes of safety amidst complex urban neighborhood changes.  
 # <hl> Why This Matters and What's at Stake
  The data dive was inspired by Ethan Bottone's critical GIS analysis of New Orleans in "'Please Mention the Green Book:' The *Negro Motorist* Green Book as Critical GIS." Using the *Green Book* as a critical mapping tool, we can learn more about both the spatial geography of Jim Crow America and the landscapes of safety therein. While vehicles themselves had a "twin symbolism of mobility and freedom," (Piercy 2) this era of black mobility and the Great Migration offer a glimpse of what Harriet Jacobs calls a "loophole of retreat," a strategic site where one can safely surveil and be shielded from the world's dangers while offering power to shift one's fate. While the effectiveness of this network is hard to singularly quantify, one could view the Great Migration’s relocation of over 6 million Blacks from the rural South to the urban North, Midwest, and West and the subsequent economic and political benefits as a measure of its efficacy. 
 # <hl> Spatial Scope
  The spatial scope is limited to the city of Los Angeles given that I’m interested in understanding neighborhood change and black geographies in this city more deeply. This study may later extend to broader Southern California definition including but not limited to Pasadena if the dates is more robust after further investigation of the Green Book data.
